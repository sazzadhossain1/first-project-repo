            <h2 class="font-size">Know our <br> Global community</h2>

            <p class="paragraph">If you want to grow as a developer,
                 I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a 
                 developer community. There are many advantages,
                  from peer-programming to sharing knowledge,
                   mentorship, sharing support, sharing tools,
                    code reviews, answering questions, and much more.


                Communities are usually built on shared struggles of 
                individuals learning in a particular region, and the
                 goals of each community differ per the individual's 
                 collective needs.
